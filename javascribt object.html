Objects and its internal representation in JavaScript ?

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs that represent properties of an entity.
The keys are strings
or Symbols, and the values can be any data type, including other objects.
The internal representation of an object in
JavaScript is called its "object structure" or "object layout."
This includes information about the object's properties,
such as their names, values, and types, as well as information about the object's prototype (if it has one) and any
other internal data.
The specifics of the object structure can vary depending on the JavaScript engine and implementation,
but generally, it is designed to be fast and efficient for property lookups and other common operations
on objects.

There are 3 ways to create an object in JavaScript:

1. By object literal

2. By creating an instance of Object

3. By Object Constructor

Since JavaScript is essentially an object-oriented scripting language,
It supports and encourages the usage of objects
while developing web applications.

}

Functions of objects:

1. Array.prototype.map()
2. Array.prototype.filter()
3. promises
4. bacon.js

A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object.
JavaScript provides a special constructor function called object() to build the object.
The return value of the object() constructor is assigned to a variable.
