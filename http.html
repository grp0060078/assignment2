DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2:

HTTP1.1:

-It works on the textual format.
-There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it does not get its all resources.
-It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
-It compresses data by itself.


HTTP2:
-It works on the binary protocol.
-It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
-It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
-It uses HPACK for data compression.
